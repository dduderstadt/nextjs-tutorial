## Navigation

### Why optimize navigation?

To link between pages, you'd traditionally use the `<a>` HTML element. At the moment, the sidebar links use `<a>` elements, but notice what happens when you navigated between the home, invoices, and customers pages on your browser...

There's a FULL page refresh each page navigation! (bad performance)
